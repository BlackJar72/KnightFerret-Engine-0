This it a framework (not technically an engine, but not just a library) for 
creating arcade style and other 2d games for PC in Java.  Its based on 
Java Swing, and assumes the keyboard is the primary input.  It is based 
largely on the code for Macy Mae's Eating Adventure and is the basis of 
Ship Swarm Shoot-Up.  An attempt has been made at porting this to Android, 
but it turns out to be very badly designed for that platform (though if I 
knew Android better and had an actual test device it might be easier to 
work out).
